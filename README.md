# RECIPE APP
## Introduction
Welcome to the Recipe App, a Django-based web application designed to help users manage their own recipes. This app allows users to store recipe details, including cooking time, ingredients, and difficulty level.
The application is built using Django's robust framework, providing a structured database model, seamless migrations, and an easy-to-use interface for interacting with recipes.
